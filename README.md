# morse-works
Utilities for manipulating Morse Code (CW) data streams

## morsewords.py
A commandline script for converting a file of words (one per line) to a form which [ebook2cw](https://fkurz.net/ham/ebook2cw.html) can take as input to generate MP3 files for ICR (instant character recognition) practice.

```code
$ scripts/morsewords.py -h
usage: morsewords.py [-h] [-u] [-i INFILE] [-o OUTFILE]
                     [-fw {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}] [-s SPEED] [-ss SSTEP]
                     [-f FREQUENCY] [-fs FSTEP]

Convert a list of words into Ebooks to CW format

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u, --unique          Remove duplicate words (default: false)
  -i INFILE, --infile INFILE
                        input file (defaults to 'in.txt')
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        output file (defaults to 'out.txt')
  -fw {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, --farnsworth {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
                        # of WPM to reduce nominal rate to effective rate
  -s SPEED, --speed SPEED
                        starting WPM speed (defaults to 15)
  -ss SSTEP, --sstep SSTEP
                        WPM speed increase step size (defaults to 5)
  -f FREQUENCY, --frequency FREQUENCY
                        starting audio frequency in Hz (defaults to 600)
  -fs FSTEP, --fstep FSTEP
                        audio frequency reduction step size in Hz (defaults to
                        25)
                        audio frequency reduction step size in Hz (defaults to 25)
```
